# Exercise-Routine-System
This project was developed as a practice exercise for learning and applying data structures in C.

This project is a command-line based user management system that allows users to sign up, log in, manage personal details, create and view exercise routines, and maintain notes. The system uses linked lists, stacks, queues, and various algorithms to manage dynamic data and supports basic functionalities like authentication, data editing, and sorting.

Algorithms

    Stack: Used to manage exercise routines, allowing users to add and remove the last added exercise.
    Queue: Used to manage user notes, allowing users to add and remove notes in a FIFO manner.
    Linear Search: Used to search for users by their username.
    Selection Sort: Used to sort and display all users by their age.
